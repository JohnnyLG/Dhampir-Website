## Exercises

1. Write a program that prints your name 100 times. (names.py)
2. Write a program to fill the screen horizontally and vertically with your name. [Hint: add the
option end='' into the print function to fill the screen horizontally.] (screen.py)
3. Write a program that outputs 100 lines, numbered 1 to 100, each with your name on it. The
output should look like the output below. (number_name.py)
    ```
    1 Your name
    2 Your name
    3 Your name
    4 Your name
    ...
    100 Your name
    ```
4. Write a program that prints out a list of the integers from 1 to 20 and their squares. The output
should look like this (integers.py)
    ```
    1 --- 1
    2 --- 4
    3 --- 9
    ...
    20 --- 400
    ```
5. Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, . . . , 83, 86, 89. (sequence.py)
6. Write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 100, 98, 96, . . . , 4, 2. (even.py)
7. Write a program that uses exactly four for loops to print the sequence of letters below. (four.py)
    ```

8. Write a program that asks the user for their name and how many times to print it. The program should print out the user’s name the specified number of times (names_input.py)
9. The Fibonacci numbers are the sequence below, where the first two numbers are 1, and each number thereafter is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to print and then prints that many.
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 . . . (fibonacci.py)
10. Use a for loop to print a box like the one below. Allow the user to specify how wide and how high the box should be. [Hint: print('*'*10) prints ten asterisks.] (box.py)
    ```

    *******************
    *******************
    *******************
    ```
11. Use a for loop to print a box like the one below. Allow the user to specify how wide and how high the box should be. (empty.py)
